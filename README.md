# Bravdica_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

SUMMARY:
Based off of assignment 7, I added on username/password that are needed to access movie rentals. You either enter an existing username or password or you create a new account. Account info is saved to a txt file that will save the information even when the program is closed so that the information can be saved.

HOW TO RUN:
You need the main.cpp, MovieTree.h, MovieTree.cpp as well as the txt file Users.txt to run the program. You will need to create a project w/ a class and copy the three programs to their respective files. Have the txt file in the same folder as the programs.

DEPENDENCIES:
N/A

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
I just used the Code::Blocks compiler that is on the VM.

GROUP MEMBERS:
Just me ( Ryan Bravdica )

CONTRIBUTORS:
None so far

OPEN ISSUES/BUGS:
Everytime the program is opened after the first time it is run, I get a seg fault because it forgets where the head of the linked list is
Probably even more issues once I fix that problem
I want to add a function that remembers what each account/user has rented in the past and be able to display those movies
